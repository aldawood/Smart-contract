==============
The self-governing contractual system is a system that allows contracts to be
managed by private institutions in a competitive market. I call it a self-governing
system because, as opposed to the legal contractual system, all outcomes of the
contract must be pre-determined by the contracting parties themselves at the time of
establishing the contract.

In the self-governing contractual system, a contract is defined as "an agreement between
two or more persons that details transfers of properties in dierent future possibilities." So, a contract is a deterministic function that maps different future possibilities to an operation of property transfer between contracting parties. This function can be represented as a table I call the contract table.
